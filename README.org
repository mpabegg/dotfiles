** Installation

Most things will be installed by [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] and configured by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]. That's great!

Some manual steps are still required.

*** Command Line Tools (CLT) for Xcode
First of all, we need to install the Command Line Tools (CLT) for Xcode:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

*** Homebrew
Next we can install Homebrew
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

*** Clone the repo into the $HOME/.dotfiles
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:mpabegg/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
#+END_SRC
